11. Suppose your main() function has the following line:
    
    cout << "Please enter your PIN: ";

    And suppose the compiler complains that cout is an unknown identifier. What
    is the likely cause of this complaint, and what are three ways to fix the
    problem.

Answer:
    Either the <iostream> header file is not included and the std namespace is
    not used that causes the compiler complains that cout is an unknown
    identifier.
    
    Three ways to fixed this is the following:
    
    a) Include the header file iostream and fully qualify the cout object using
       the std namespace.

       #include <iostream>
       int main()
       {
           std::cout << "Please enter your PIN: ";
       }

    b) Include the header file iostream and use the std namespace.

       #include <iostream>
       using namespace std;
       int main()
       {
           cout << "Please enter your PIN: ";
       }

    b) Include the header file iostream and use the std namespace inside the
       function.

       #include <iostream>
       int main()
       {
           using namespace std;
           cout << "Please enter your PIN: ";
       }
